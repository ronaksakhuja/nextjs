DTU Farewell 2020
=================

I graduated from Delhi Technological University in 2020. If you still remember, that was the first year of the Covid-19 Pandemic. There was a lockdown all over the world, and things in New Delhi were not going any better. In normal times, we have a farewell party in our university consisting of Dance, music and everyone writing short farewell messages on each other's tshirts. These messages are called scribbles.

With everything going Online, and our colleges being shut down, I along with my friends decided to make a website and try to replicate what we do in an offline farewell. We created a social media website for our farewell in a few days, built on **PHP Codeigniter framework and Mysql database** and launched it to our batch of more than 2000 students.
